# ðŸš§ Work in Perpetual Progress ðŸš§

## To-Do List

- [x] Fix theme of overall site ---> d0c0f0 fff 000
- [x] Add multiple videos support for project cards ---> can randomise the first video to pop up
- [x] Seperate projects based on category ---> adding tags and filters yet to be done
- [ ] Fix overflow of project desc text on the back of project cards ---> typing animation is not working (to be resolved, code already exists)
- [ ] Use different backgrounds for different pages  ---> codes ready, issues with position match wrt other pages
- [ ] Separate js and css from the `index.html` and reference them accordingly  ---> must do, to improve scalability
- [ ] Create a **Skills** page
- [ ] Collect content for skills page ---> icons vs names
- [ ] More projects to included in **Projects** page --analog --iot --ros2 --cv etc
- [ ] Seperate sections to be added for subfiels --perception --navigation --path planning --control etc [preferably timeline]
- [ ] Adding tags for projects and add filters based on them + sort --some projects come under multiple categs
- [ ] Add more content to the **About** page  
- [ ] Add social media cards that pop up when hovered over their respective icons [cards are ready --building js logic]
- [ ] **Contact Page**  
  - [ ] Implement social media icons with a `turtlesim` drawing of tree *(**Currently Active**)*  
- [x] Start a tech blog using **Jekyll** or **Hugo** *(**Currently active**)*
  - [x] First Blogs: (chirpy or minimal if Jekyll)
    - [x] "Hello World" post with a brief personal introduction  
    - [x] Introduction to blogging on GitHub Pages
    - [ ] Other starters
  - [ ] Rubik's Cube Solver [7+ parts]:
    - [ ] Intro to cube solving, its mechanics  
    - [ ] Types and methods to solve using traditional standard methodsâ€”CFOP/Fridrich, Roux....  
    - [ ] How can computers come into playâ€”explaining the number of cases to be solved [12 rejected one]  
    - [ ] Types of algorithms to solve all cases and approach building  
    - [ ] Optimizing the solution  
    - [ ] Unity 3D approach to reverify by running simulations [2â€“3 parts explaining how to, if required]  
    - [ ] Mechanical integration, selection of motors to be used -- considering 1 fixed 5 free approach [5] 
    - [ ] Coding the algorithms [walkthrough with optimization of the process]  
    - [ ] TO BE ADDED
  - [ ] Project ProtoX
- [ ] Create separate sections for **Resume** (using Overleaf LaTeX) and **Blog**  
- [ ] Improve SEO for the website  ---> current sitemaps are screwed up, made it still harder to find ||| should wait for 2-3 weeks
- [ ] Add a link to the **Shopping Cart Bot** project and improve its documentation  ---> should push some code as well before documenting (espip|ros2|etc)
- [ ] Should optimise for mobile screen ---> some unwanted optimisations for timeline should be removed, also the font size of headers should be dec in mobile screens
- [ ] Should include a photo on home page

All empty repos must be deleted 

All small projects should be grouped together to save space on the projects page --all webots projects under "purpose-specific/concept bots"
